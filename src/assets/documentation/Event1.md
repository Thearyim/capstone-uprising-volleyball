# Unified Sport Beach Volleyball Clinic with Jeremy CasebeerTomorrow Warriors has organized the first beach volleyball Unified Sport clinic at Uprising Volleyball.   Athletes with and without disabilities will have the opportunity to work with AVP and Team USA pro beach volleyball player Jeremy Casebeer to learn the basic skills of beach volleyball.  Special thanks to [Five12 Apparel](https://five12apparel.com/), [AVPFirst](http://avpfirst.com/), North Sound Physical Therapy and [Ink It Your Way](http://www.inkityourway.com/) for making this clinics possible.   Please say thanks to them for making this work. What is Unified Sport?Dedicated to promoting social inclusion through shared sports training and competition experiences, Unified Sports joins people with and without intellectual disabilities on the same team. It was inspired by a simple principle: training together and playing together is a quick path to friendship and understanding.In Unified Sports, teams are made up of people of similar age and ability, which makes practices more fun and games more challenging and exciting for all. Having sport in common is just one more way that preconceptions and false ideas are swept away.Our opponent is intolerance. Only shoulder-to-shoulder, as teammates together, can we defeat it.
